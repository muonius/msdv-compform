# Introduction

This is the summary of my course study of Computational Form at Parsons' Data Visualization MS porgram in Spring 2022. This course is a life changer for me and as a two-time graduate student, I think I've earned the experience to say this is the best class I have ever taken in my life. This course is taught by Justin Bakse. He also created a "textbook" [Comp Form](https://compform.net/) to accompany the teaching.

I learned the following creative coding concepts and techniques:

- Random Value
- Noise, Perlin Noise, Noise Loop
- Parameterized Design, Tweakpine
- Pixel Data in Canvas
- Drawing Using Periodic Functions (The Magical Sin & Cos)
- Vector Drawing with Paper.js
- Turtle Graphics and Recursive Trees
- Generating Text Using RiTa, Markov, and Tracery
- Basic Data Sonification
- Physics Engine with Matter.js
- WebGL
- Bezier Curves
- Particle Systems (An Extension of p5.Vector or Physics Engine)

I fell in love with creative coding because of this course. I hope to continue this journey.

### Some of My Favorite Sketches
